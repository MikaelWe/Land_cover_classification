# Land_cover_classification

Imagine you want to classify a satellite image amoung 10 categories. I think almost everyone is able to do it.

Imagine you want to classify 5000 images. I think almost no one will have the patience to do it.

Imagine you have a computer with you. You could use its power and speed of calculation to do it. But how ?

You could try to find the perfect algorithm that will test thousand of conditions : What are the differences between an industrial and a residential area ?

From which distance between houses you can consider that this is residencial ? How the computer will now if this is a road or a river ? The color, distance, width ? Difficult to find these values to describe all the differences.

And what happens if your boss give you "classical" images instead of satellite images. A pasture photo has nothing to do with the one taken by a satellite...You spent X months working on the perfect algorithm for nothing... 

And what if instead of creating all the conditions, you let the machine learn by itself giving some examples and using some mathematicals functions and tools. That is deep learning.

The project describes a deep learning model (and some variants) enable to classify satellite images amoung 10 categories.
